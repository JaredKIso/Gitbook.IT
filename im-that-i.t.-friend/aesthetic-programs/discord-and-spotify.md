# Discord & Spotify

## Overview

The overall goal of this page is to help in quickly setting up and configuring your Discord and Spotify to look good.&#x20;

In the end it is going to look something like this:

**Discord**:

**Spotify**:

## Discord

Alright lets get started on setting up Discord to make it look good.&#x20;

1.  To be-able to use themes on Discord you have to use a different Discord client, for this guide we will be using Vencord: [https://vencord.dev/](https://vencord.dev/).

    &#x20;\- **Heads Up**: It is _technically_ against Discord's ToS but there is very little chance you will be banned for it as rarely ANYONE has gotten banned by it.&#x20;
2. Click the "Download Vencord" then click the pink "VencordInstaller.exe" and let it download.
3.  Fully close/quit discord, click "Quit Discord" from the tray on the bottom right of your screen.

4. Open "VencordInstaller.exe" and just click the green "Install" button. It will go ahead and install then you can launch Discord.

( If the above is confusing here is a video guide: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1su9KBkT\_s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1su9KBkT_s))\
&#x20;

5. Now that Vencord is installed, you can go ahead and open the settings in Discord and scroll down and you will see a section labelled "Vencord".&#x20;

5. You will see a tab called "Themes" go ahead and click that.

6. Click "Online Themes" at the top and go ahead and paste this url: " [https://refact0r.github.io/midnight-discord/midnight.css](https://refact0r.github.io/midnight-discord/midnight.css) " (Without the quotes) in the box under "Online Themes".

7. It should apply, if it did not go ahead and restart.

(To get more themes you can go to "[https://betterdiscord.app/themes](https://betterdiscord.app/themes)" or "[https://github.com/topics/vencord-theme](https://github.com/topics/vencord-theme)".)

There you go, you should have a nicer looking Discord now! Vencord has a lot more features that you can mess with, one of them that I would suggest is the "Plugins" page. The plugins can add a lot more to Discord that are Quality of Life based.

* **Some plugins I would suggest are**:
  * ClearURLs (Removed tracking from URLs)
  * FavoriteEmojiFirst
  * FixSpotifyEmbeds
  * PinDMs
  * SpotifyControls

## Spotify

Alright now we will go ahead and get your Spotify looking nice! This is going to look like a lot but don't worry as I got you.&#x20;

1.  Go to [https://spicetify.app/](https://spicetify.app/) and click "Install Now". This will redirect you to an install page.

    &#x20;\- From here it will look like a lot, in reality you don't have to do much.
2.  Hit your `⊞ Win` key and type in "Terminal" and it should say "Windows PowerShell" in the tab like this:<br>

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
3.  From here, you are just going to paste in the following:\
    " `iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli/master/install.ps1 | iex` " then hit "Enter" on your Keyboard\
    \--- Also paste this in once that is done: ---\
    `iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-marketplace/main/resources/install.ps1 | iex` then hit "Enter" on your keyboard again.

    &#x20;\- If a&#x20;
4. Then that is about all you need to do, you can go into Spotify and a new option should have appeared that says "Marketplace".

5.  Click on "Martketplace" click on "Themes" on the top bar then you can hover over the theme you want and click "Install".

    &#x20;\- "Blossom" is the theme I use if you want the one I have.

That should be it and the basics of it. You can go more into getting custom themes that are not on there but that is a bit more complicated. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you find one you specifically want that is not a point and click install.
