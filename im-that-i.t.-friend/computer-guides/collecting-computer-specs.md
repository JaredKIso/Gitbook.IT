# Collecting Computer Specs

In this guide we are going to make it quick and simple to collect your PC specs. This will help with troubleshooting, upgrading, etc...

***

### Option 1. (Speccy) ★★☆☆☆

This is probably the easiest way to get your PC specs. Just the most difficult part will be the install process.

* Go to this link: [https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy)
* Click "Download Free Version"

* It will scroll you down to another page where you can click on the left most option which says "Free Download"

* You will be brought to another page that has more download options. Again, just click the "Download" button under "Free Speccy" column.

* Once you hit "Download" give it a second and it will download!
* Launch the ".exe" file that was downloaded. You may be prompted with a yes or no option to run it on your system, hit "yes.
* This window should appear after you launch the ".exe".

* Now all you gotta do is hit "Install" and then it will bring you to this window where you can just hit "Run Speccy".

* Feel free to uncheck the "view release notes", if you are reading this guide you more than likely do not care about those.
* Give it a second and it will collect all your system specs for you!

Now you got your system specs one way that you can share to your IT friend. If they need more info, feel free to follow the below option :)&#x20;

### Option 2. (Task Manager/Sysinfo) ★★★★☆

* Open your task manager.
* You can open your task manager by hitting the `⊞ Win` key and typing "Task Manager", or by right clicking your task bar and clicking "Task Manager".
* From here it may look different depending on if you are on Windows 11 or Windows 10.
* You'll see icons on the left side, if you click the hamburger menu (the ≡) you can make it show the names for windows 11. For windows 10, it will just be listed at the top.
*   Now, click on "Performance". It will look like this<br>

* The main things you want here are: CPU, Memory, and GPU.
  * You will see the main name of the device on the top right, then the more detailed info at the bottom.

Now that we got that information we can close task manager and get the last screenshot that is needed.&#x20;

* Hit the `⊞ Win` again and type "sysinfo" then hit the "Enter" key on your keyboard.
* This will bring up a bunch of info on your screen. Just screenshot this and document it somewhere that works best for you.

You have now gotten most of your pc specs for you or your friend to reference!&#x20;
